# Planet Kevin

**The code behind the 2019 version of planetkevin.com**

## Instructions

The stack here is Github Pages -> Gatsby SSR -> React -> GraphQL -> Redux -> Aframe

From the directory containing this ReadMe file, run the following three lines of code to see my website running on your machine at localhost:8000.

You will need current npm and node installed

```
npm install --global gatsby-cli
npm install
gatsby develop
```

## Gatsby and GraphQL

This app uses Gatsby and GraphQL for performance and ease-of-use purposes.

## AFrame and Device Orientation

The main item of interest in this app in April 2019 is the integration of Gatsby-GraphQL->React structures into the VR Space controlled by AFrame and handheld devices. From the *creative* link, the main portion of the screen is a VR environment that you control by headset or phone or tablet movements. Specifically, if you tilt your device or headset in a forward or reverse direction, you move along a row of images. At either end of the image row is a video which you can play. On one side, it is a 2D image on a plane within the VR world; on the other, it is an immersive sphere where you enter the world.

## Only the Beginning

This page is intended to be regularly updated. Please return to see changes.

**This began from a V2 starter project**
