Kevin proved to be a hard working leader sharing his knowledge with the younger, less experienced staff.  As his director, I could count on Kevin to execute on tasks going far beyond my expectations. He spent long hours making sure that his solutions were in place when the team needed them.  At crunch time he was there for team, driven by his passion for responsive product, never losing his sense of humor and always willing to learn from others. You’ll find Kevin challenging everyone to pick a number between 1 and 1000 and he’ll start reciting the square before you take your next breath.  If you’re still not impressed, you can give 2 numbers and he’ll multiply them in the same time. Kevin is an asset to any team.",

Kevin's personable nature, attention to detail and ability to relay complex subject matter in a concise fashion allowed Mediaplex to forge strong relationships with its publishers, in most cases allowing Mediaplex to be accredited with formal certification for rich media delivery. Our internal Engineering Group has also benefited from the knowledge he has transferred to the point of him being considered a thought leader, playing a hand in future architectural decisions.
