Kevin is a really great person to work with and I challenge you to find better in the relevant field.\",\n      \"Created\": \"12/16/15, 6:34 PM\",\n      \"Status\": \"VISIBLE\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"First\": \"Christopher\",\n      \"Last\": \"Robison\",\n      \"Company\": \"Conversant (formerly Mediaplex)\",\n      \"Title\": \"Senior Software Engineering Manager\",\n      \"Text\": \"Kevin has consistently demonstrated an eagerness to tackle new projects, dedication to professional growth, and the initiative to conceptualize new ways to improve client results and internal efficiencies.\",\n      \"Created\": \"2/19/13, 11:36 AM\",\n      \"Status\": \"VISIBLE\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"First\": \"Paul\",\n      \"Last\": \"Headley\",\n      \"Company\": \"KarHead\",\n      \"Title\": \"Chief Technology Officer\",\n      \"Text\": \"Kevin’s focus on team productivity was clear from the first day of work. His ability to take hold of the product line and quickly simplify the development process impressed me the most. He immediately added value with inventive solutions providing remarkable improvements to the UI. His insightful early work was a platform for a strategy that easily integrated the most complex solutions.  Kevin proved to be a hard working leader sharing his knowledge with the younger, less experienced staff.  As his director, I could count on Kevin to execute on tasks going far beyond my expectations. He spent long hours making sure that his solutions were in place when the team needed them.  At crunch time he was there for team, driven by his passion for responsive product, never losing his sense of humor and always willing to learn from others. You’ll find Kevin challenging everyone to pick a number between 1 and 1000 and he’ll start reciting the square before you take your next breath.  If you’re still not impressed, you can give 2 numbers and he’ll multiply them in the same time. Kevin is an asset to any team.\",\n      \"Created\": \"7/8/15, 6:39 PM\",\n      \"Status\": \"VISIBLE\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"First\": \"Gregg\",\n      \"Last\": \"Dessen\",\n      \"Company\": \"Ebates\",\n      \"Title\": \"VP, Product Management & Platform Services\",\n      \"Text\": \"Kevin is a very talented and innovative developer who is adept at delivering high quality work under pressure, intense deadlines, and through shifts in strategy.

He was swiftly able to tackle immediate problems of iframe security and rendering of expandable advertisements on high traffic pages, often tailoring his solution to accommodate nuances of different sites and their architectures. Kevin's personable nature, attention to detail and ability to relay complex subject matter in a concise fashion allowed Mediaplex to forge strong relationships with its publishers, in most cases allowing Mediaplex to be accredited with formal certification for rich media delivery. Our internal Engineering Group has also benefited from the knowledge he has transferred to the point of him being considered a thought leader, playing a hand in future architectural decisions.     Kevin's overall success with this project and the timely delivery of a robust permanent solution has paved the way for significant revenue opportunities for Mediaplex and its Rich Media business.
